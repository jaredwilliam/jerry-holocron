## Tagging System
### Type of Note
Identify the primary nature of the note, helping with basic content organization. 

Examples:
- #type/task -> to-do items
- #type/project -> projects
- #type/reflection -> personal thoughts
- #type/reading -> reading notes (notes taken while reading)
- #type/study -> learning material (notes taken while intentionally learning something)
- #type/document -> notes about a document
- #type/quote -> a quote saved to a note
- #type/person -> a note about a person
- #type/recipe -> a note about a recipe
- #type/event -> a note about something I did or went to

### Context Tags
Indicate the environment or circumstances where the note applies. 

Examples:
- #context/studies -> general learning material
- #context/work -> career related notes
- #context/personal -> personal development

### Theme Tags
Organize content by broad area of knowledge or interest.

Programming and Technology
- #theme/AI -> artificial intelligence
- #theme/algorithms -> algorithms and data structures
- #theme/dev -> software development

Humanities
- #theme/stoicism -> Stoic philosophy
- #theme/history -> historical studies

Health and Wellness
- #theme/fitness -> exercise and nutrition

Culture and Entertainment
- #theme/games -> games and game development
- #theme/literature -> books and reading
- #theme/movies -> cinema and series

### Metadata Tags
Control notes: status, priority, and review needs. 

Status
- #status/in-progress -> under development
- #status/completed -> finished 
- #status/planning -> initial phase

Prioritization
- #priority/high → Urgent
- #priority/medium → Important
- #priority/low → Can wait

Review Control
- #review/needed -> needs review
- #review/completed -> already reviewed

## Required Minimum Tags
To maintain consistency and facilitate search, each not should include at a minimum:
1. One type tag
2. One context tag
3. One theme tag
4. One metadata tag when needed
