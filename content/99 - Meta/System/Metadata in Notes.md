Some common frontmatter:
- `title`: Title of the note. 
- `description`: Description of the note. Used for link previews when published. 
- `aliases`: Other names for the note. This is a list of strings.
- `tags`: Tags for the note.
- `draft`: Whether to publish the note or not. `True` will prevent the note from being published. 
- `date`: A string representing the day the note was created. Uses `YYYY-MM-DD` formatting. 

At a minimum, I try to include `date`, `draft`, and `tags`.
