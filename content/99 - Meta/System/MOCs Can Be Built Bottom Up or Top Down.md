Maps of Content (MOCs) or Index notes can be built up either by starting from the bottom or the top. 

I have found, generally, when I intentionally am learning something new, building the MOC from the top feels more natural. 

For example, I don't have much knowledge on making quilts. If I became interested in that hobby, I would naturally start broad and shallow when obtaining new knowledge, and go deeper as I learn more. The development of a MOC and it's related notes *feels* more natural if I approach it the same way. Meaning, I would make a "Quilting" MOC and add material to it as I learn more.

When I happen to stumble upon knowledge that I found interesting, and if it is already in my vault, I would naturally relate it to other items. These relationships could be any direction within the hierarchy (up, down, laterally). But it *feels* natural to also try to categorize "accidental" knowledge, meaning it would be connected to a MOC note. 

There are exceptions to these general rules of course.
