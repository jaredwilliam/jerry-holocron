# System Principles
## Limited Hierarchy
The system adopts a controlled depth structure, allowing only one level of nesting within the main folders. This decision is based on proven knowledge management principles:

- **Access Efficiency**: Maximum of two clicks to reach any information
- **Complexity Reduction**: Avoids "analysis paralysis" when deciding where to store notes
- **Redundancy Prevention**: Minimizes content duplication
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Facilitates content organization and reorganization

## Flexibility
Instead of using deep folder hierarchies, the system uses:
- Tags for multidimensional categorization
- Links to create natural connections between content
- MOCs (Maps of Content) to visualize hierarchies when needed
