It is inevitable that an election doesn't go *someone's* way. If it didn't go your way, you may find yourself anxious and worried. Even if it did go your way and you feel some sort of relief, the truth is, none of us know how this will go. 

What are we to do?

What does it all mean?

What if it is about to get really bad?

You are not wrong to think about those questions but you are likely mistaken in thinking that what has happened or what is going to happen is going to change anything.

This isn't to say elections don't matter - they do - and they impact everyone's life. However, the results of an election doesn't change what is asked **of you** or what your obligations are. 

It doesn't matter if a tyrant king or a wise philosopher comes to power - or even yourself. You are still expected **to be good**. You are still expected **to be a person of virtue**. 

![[I Must Be What I Am#^0679f5]]

Whatever happens in life our job remains our job, our duty our duty. How does this stop you from acting with [[The Stoic Virtues|courage, discipline, justice, and wisdom]]?

In fact, it may well be that these election results present you with an incredible and urgent opportunity to act with those virtues. 

When [[Vespasian|The Roman Emperor Vespasian]] tried to prevent [[Helvidius Priscus|Helvidius Priscus The Senator]] from criticizing him, Helvidius responded with:

> Helvidius: It is in your power not to allow me to be a member of the senate, but so long as I am I must go in and I must say what I think right.

> Vespasian: But if you do, I shall put you to death.

> Helvidius: You will do your part. I will do mine. 

Our job today is the same that it always has been. And this is going to be true tomorrow. Our job is to be good, to be wise, to stand up for what is right, to resist what is wrong and evil. 

Nothing changes that. Nothing exempts us form that. Nothing prevents us from doing that. 

The consequences and the costs and the stakes can change, and the election results may well have done that. But the obligation remains. The duty remains.
