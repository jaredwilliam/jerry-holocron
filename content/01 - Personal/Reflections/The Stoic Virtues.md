[[The Stoics]] believed there were four virtues:
- Wisdom (the owl)
- Courage (the lion)
- Temperance (the wine)
- Justice (the scales)

Everything we face in life is an opportunity to respond with these four traits. 

Even bad situations. 

Even painful or scary ones. 

If we act virtuously, everything else important will follow.
