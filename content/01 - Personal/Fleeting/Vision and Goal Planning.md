Vision -> Three Year Goals -> 12 Week Goals -> Weekly Plan -> Daily Plan

**Questions To Help Remember Why Your Goals Are Important to You**
Answer these when making the goal so you can reference them later when unmotivated.
- Why are the elements of your vision important to you?
- What will you be able to do if you reach your vision that you cannot do now?
- What will be different for you, your family, your friends, your peers, your clients, your community, if you reach that goal?
- Are you willing to commit to the actions needed to reach your vision?
- Who have you shared your vision with?
- How often have you looked at your vision since you wrote it?
- What actions do you have to take to make progress on your vision and reach your 12 week goal?
- What risks or barriers exist that may get in the way of you reaching your vision and goals?
- How can I best support and help you achieve your goals and visions?

## Vision
### Common Pitfalls
**You don't take the power of vision seriously**
- It is common to want to skip creating a vision and dive into action. 
- However, when the going gets difficult, it is harder to stay committed to the work in the long run because there is no compelling reason, no persuasive *why*. 
- Making the effort to record your vision and the why behind it give you the opportunity to go back to it when you are feeling unmotivated or simply forget. 
- Reviewing it can help you remember why the hard work you've been doing is important and the impact it can have. 
- And it can help you revise or increment that vision to something even better, providing even more motivation. 

**The vision isn't meaningful to you**
- Creating a superficial vision isn't going to provide lasting motivation. 
- Keep working on crafting the vision until it connects to you meaningfully.

**Your Vision is too small**
- A small vision doesn't call on our best efforts. 
- If you set a vision too small, you won't have to stretch yourself - there won't be a challenge. And even if you complete this small vision, you won't be satisfied - it won't feel fulfilling because you didn't "prove yourself" to yourself. There was no growth. 
- Your vision should make you uncomfortable and make you question if you can accomplish it. 

**You don't connect your vision to your daily actions**
- Each day is an opportunity to either make progress on your vision or move further away from it.
- If you work from a plan that is aligned with your vision, you can be sure that you are acting on the most important things every day. 

### Success Tips
- Share it with others - having others know about it could help you stay accountable for it.
	- Although, sometimes, I have found that talking about a vision or goal gives you a hit of dopamine, making you feel like you have already accomplished it, which may make you less likely to actually work toward it. 
- Stay in touch with your vision - review it regularly.
- Live with intention - daily, weekly, etc., review the progress that you made in that time period. Did it move you forward towards your goals and visions? Or was it filled with activity that wasn't related? 

## Developing Your 12 Week Plan
Planning is beneficial
- Having a bias toward taking action is a good thing, unless you skip planning. Only taking action will cause for ineffective execution. Your plan will help you ensure that you are taking action on the right things - things that move you toward your vision. Without a plan, you won't really know if you are moving toward your vision. You may feel like you are, but you'll inevitably wander off course. The plan helps you stay aligned. 
- Even if you *know* what to do, *knowing* isn't enough. The world is full of distractions, the unexpected happens, our innate desire for comfort tugs at us, and we lost focus. 
- Creating a *written* plan will help you avoid or move past the distractions and unexpected. 

### Game Changer
- You can live life reactively or proactively. Being reactive will cause you to be suboptimal in your execution because your focus will be dependent on things outside of your control. 
- Being proactive - by writing an action-based plan - will allow you to focus on the highest value items that move you toward your vision and goals. 
- The 12 week plan will help you get more of the *right things* done each day, and ultimately help you reach goals faster and with greater impact. 
- 12 week planning also allows you to be consistently focused on the few vital actions that drive results. 
- The short time horizon also generates a sense of urgency - every day matters now. Annual plans are usually objective-based, focusing on *what* needs to be done instead of *how* to do it. The shorter time horizon gets you to focus on *how* because it is easier to see that far ahead. A year is too much time for us to comprehend and to know what life is going to look like. 
- The daily and weekly *how's* of a 12 week plan are what makes it execution-friendly. 

### Effective Plan Structure
- A good plan starts with a good goal. The goal should be specific and measurable, otherwise the plan will be vague. 
- Each goal becomes a planning target for which you need to write tactics (specific actions you must take to achieve the goal). 
- There are five criteria that will help you create a better 12 week plan when you are writing goals and tactics:
	- Criteria 1: Tactics should start with a verb and are a complete sentence. The way you write the goals and tactics matter. 
	- Criteria 2: Make the specific and measurable. Be sure to quantify and qualify what success looks like.
	- Criteria 3: State them positively. Focus on what you want to happen that is positive. E.g., instead of focusing on a "2 percent error rate", focus on a "98 percent accuracy rate". 
	- Criteria 4: Ensure they are a realistic stretch. If you can accomplish the goal without doing anything differently, you need to stretch more. If it is impossible, dial it back (e.g., if you have never lifted weights before, trying to achieve a 500 pound back squat is going to cause you to fail).
	- Criteria 5: Be time-bound. Make sure to have the date attached to the goals and tactics. 

### Establish Your 12 Week Goals
The 12 week goal is the bridge between your vision and your 12 week plan. 

List out your 12 week goals, making sure they are derived from your visions and meet all criteria listed above. 

12 Week Goals:
- Goal 1…
- Goal 2…
- Goal 3…

For each goal, write out why it is important to you.

### Writing Your 12 Week Plan

Keep in mind that planning is just problem solving - solving the problem of how to close the gap between your results today and your 12 week goal. 

For each of your goals, define the highest-priority daily and weekly actions that you must take to reach that goal. To do this, it might be helpful to brainstorm everything you could do to move toward that goal and select the ones that will have the greatest impact. 

For the actions you have selected, write them as full sentences that start with a verb and describe the action that you intend to take. 

Next, specify a due date for each action. If they are a one-time action, this would likely look like a specific date. If it is a repeated action, this due date could be "every day" or "every week". Or if the action is going to happen later within the 12 weeks (maybe it's dependent on other actions), the due date could be "due during week 5". 

Next, ask yourself these questions:
- What actions will you struggle with?
- What will you do to overcome those struggles?

Before finalizing the 12 week plan, ensure that:
- It aligns with you long-term vision.
- You stay focused (i.e., not establishing too many goals and stretching yourself too thin).
- It has only critical actions.
- It is simple.
- It is meaningful. 

## Process Control
These are tools and events that help you work your 12-week plan. It will help you structure your environment so that you can focus on actions easily, instead of having to rely on and exhausting your willpower.

### Weekly Plans
This translates the 12 week plan into daily and weekly actions. This organizes and focuses your week. This is not a glorified to-do list; rather, it reflects the critical strategic activity that needs to take place that week in order to achieve your goals. 

The weekly plan is a derivative of your 12 week plan. It is not something you create each week based on what happens to be urgent at the time. The weekly plan is populated with the actions from the 12 week plan that are due that particular week. 

### Don't Do It Alone
Find yourself some peer support - an individual or group where you both review your plans and support each other. 

Use the "Weekly Accountability Meeting". This is not where we try to hold others accountability and that result in negative consequences for not meeting the goals set for the week. It is used to identify and remove obstacles, recognize progress, create focus, and encourage action. 

Weekly Accountability Meeting Agenda
1. Individual Report: Each member states how they are tracking against their goals and how well they executed. Four areas to focus on:
	1. Your results for the 12 Week Year to date.
	2. Your weekly execution score.
	3. Intentions for the coming week.
	4. Feedback and suggestions from the group. 
2. Successful Techniques: As a group, discuss what has been working well and how to incorporate these techniques into one another's plan.
3. Encouragement. 

### The Weekly Routine
The only way you will reach your 12 week goals is by taking action on your plan each day. 

The weekly routine consist of three simple, yet powerful steps:
1. Score your week
2. Plan your week
3. Participate in a WAM

To ensure success:
- Plan each week.
- Only include strategic items from your 12 week plan (not absolutely everything you have to do - still do those things if they are absolutely needed, but we want to focus on our plan).
- Don't assume each week is going to be exactly the same.\
- Do not add new tactics each week. It's fine to add one or change one up during the 12 weeks if it's absolutely failing, but changing up tactics too often will prevent you from accomplishing anything. 
- Use the weekly plan to guide your day. 
- Make it a part of your routine.  

## Keeping Score
Effective measurement includes both lead and lag measures to provide the comprehensive feedback needed for informed decision making. 

Measurement doesn't have to be complicated to be effective, but it does need to be timely. The more frequent a measure it, the more useful it is (generally).

Your 12 week goals are your ultimate lag measure. Were you successful or not?

The lead measures are the items you can control - the actions you can take. 

A great lead measures is a measure of your weekly execution of your strategic actions - how many of the strategic actions that you planned to do this week did you actually execute on?

Don't be harsh on yourself if the weekly score is poor - just aim to improve.
